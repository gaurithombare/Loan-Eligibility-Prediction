# Loan Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible or not using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on historical data of applicants, considering factors like income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Publicly available loan dataset (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository).  
- **Features:** Applicant income, credit score, loan amount, employment status, marital status, number of dependents, etc.  
- **Target Variable:** Loan eligibility status (Approved/Not Approved).  

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualizing key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
3. **Feature Engineering** - Selecting the most relevant features to improve model performance.  
4. **Model Training** - Implementing Logistic Regression using Scikit-Learn.  
5. **Evaluation Metrics** - Assessing performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
